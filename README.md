# Data Structures and Algorithms

## This repository contains concepts, codes and applied execercises of differents data structures and algorithms

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a guide for the implementation of the main data structures and algorithms. 
Nevertheless, and before explaining the main topics, the concepts of Big O notation and recursion are explained, which 
are essential for a better understanding of the rest of the topics. Although recursion can be considered as an algorithm, 
it is explained in the early sections because some methods of the structures require recursion to function properly.

Each data structure of the below sections are divided into three parts: Concepts, Code, Exercises.
* **Concept** section provides a brief explanation of their different methods and attributes, along with graphical examples of these.
* **Code** shows, in the form of code (Python), what was explained in the previous section.
* Finally **Exercises**  contains different codes obtained from HackerRank and LeetCode where these structures are applied.

The structures contained in this repository are:
  * [Arrays](https://github.com/EdgarElizondo/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/02_Arrays)
  * [Lists](https://github.com/EdgarElizondo/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/03_Lists)
  * [Linkend List](https://github.com/EdgarElizondo/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/04_Linked_List)
  * [Stack](https://github.com/EdgarElizondo/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/05_Stack)
  * [Queue](https://github.com/EdgarElizondo/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/06_Queue)
  * [HashMaps](https://github.com/EdgarElizondo/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/07_HashMaps)
  * [Tree](https://github.com/EdgarElizondo/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/08_Tree)
  * [Graph](https://github.com/EdgarElizondo/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/09_Graph)

In the case of Graph structure
On the other hand, algorithms are classified into purpose-defined algorithms and general-purpose algorithms.

**Purpose-defined algorithms** include:
  * [Sorting](https://github.com/EdgarElizondo/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/10_Sorting)
  * [Searching](https://github.com/EdgarElizondo/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/11_Serching)

Both algorithms already have well-defined steps and serve to solve a specific problem.

On the other hand, **General-purpose algorithms** include:
  * [Greedy algorithms](https://github.com/EdgarElizondo/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/12_GreedyAlgorithms)
  * [Divide and Conquer](https://github.com/EdgarElizondo/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/13_DivideAndConquer)
  * [Dynamic Programming](https://github.com/EdgarElizondo/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/14_DynamicProgramming)


  * [Backtracking](https://github.com/EdgarElizondo/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/tree/main/15_Backtracking)

And although they require certain conditions and their implementation follows a series of steps, they do not
have a defined purpose and can be implemented to solve an endless number of problems, as long as the given
conditions are met.
